PDP-10 Emulator v0.8.6 Alpha

Developement
------------

This PDP-6/PDP-10 emulator still is under developement and is not ready yet
for production.  It almost is finished.  There is some problems in this
emulator routines.

Also other PDP6, KA10, KI10, and KL10 processors are being implemented
later.

Extended addressing support was implemented.  It might cause slightly
degaradation of performance.  Optimization will be worked later.

This TS10 emulator system now supports multi-format facility for both
virtual disk and tape supports.

KS10 SYSTEM
-----------

It now supports writing tapes when you perform backups on TOPS-10
or TOPS-20.

TOPS-10/TOPS-20 Operating System
--------------------------------

TOPS-10 v7.03/v7.04 is running fine under this current version of KS10
Emulator.  For v7.04, make sure that remove DTELDR from SYSJOB.INI before
reboot system when you finished to install TOPS-10 v7.04 software.  DTELDR
is designed for KL10 only. It will not work on KS10 system and cause Galaxy
daemons to crash.

TOPS-20 v4.1 is running fine but a problem with LOGOUT command.  It cause
the PAGLCK bug halt message when you attempted to logout.  That is known
bug for TS10 emulator.

To get them from Tim Shoppa's archives.  You need least 200 MB disk space to
download everything from his web site.  His web/ftp address is:

ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com

ITS Operating System
--------------------

ITS instructions had not implemented yet at this time.

To get ITS package with source codes:

ftp://ftp.its.os.org
ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/alan/its
ftp://ftp.swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/its

KL10 SYSTEM
-----------

KL10 Processor still is under development at this time because I need
to develop PDP-11 processor first for DTE20 interface.

TOPS-10 v7.03 was successfully loaded and run but no dot prompt was
printed yet due to some lack of DTE20 communications.

Instructions to run the emulator
--------------------------------

To install TOPS-10 series, check your MIG manual.

This T10 emulator now have socket interface so that you can telnet into
the TS10 emulator by usint telnet command.

$ telnet <hostname> <port>

With TS10 default, its port is 5000.  You can change it in a ks10_fe.c file.

To run the TS10 emulator system first: (If no TS10> prompt displayed,
just press CR key to print it.)

$ ./ts10 -f ks10.cfg
  ------------------
TS10>

To enter the KS10 system on other xterm or terminal, type:

$ telnet localhost 5000
  ---------------------

Then run system at TS10> prompt:

TS10> boot rpa0
      ---------

Then do something on xterm that you are telneting into.  That is all.

Now you can mount/dismount pack/tape files on TS10> prompt without
affecting running PDP-10 system.  That finally is real timeshare.

For more information about TS10 commands, just press '?' to
display listing of commands with usage.

Thank you!
