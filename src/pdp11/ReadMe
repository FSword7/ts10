PDP-11 Emulator v0.7 (Alpha)
----------------------------

This PDP-11 emulator emulates F11 and J11 microprocessor for MicroPDP
machines.  FP11 and CIS are not implemented yet (still under
developement).

Current Development Status
--------------------------
KDF11 Processor - FP11/CIS Not implemented Yet.
KDJ11 Processor - FP11/CIS Not Implemented Yet.
(Other processors like KA11, etc. may be implemented some day.)

KDF11 Series Processor
----------------------
Some F11 implementation is not finished yet but RT-11 and XXDP operating
system will boot successfully.

KDJ11 Series Processor
----------------------
Use BDV11 boot device with 4K BDV11 firmware at this time.  I attempted
to boot KDJ11B firmware but it crashed quickly due to MRV12 boot device
(incompatible) with 'E 76' message on screen.  I am looking for complete
MRV-11D Universal specs to implement.

On XXDP tests, all basic instructions passed on ZKDJB2.BIC.

Bootstrap Images
----------------
This PDP-11 emulator supports firmwares to boot any devices.  There
are three known bootstraps: BDV11, KDF11B-BE, and KDF11B-BH firmware
images.  You can find them through Internet.

If you want to develop own bootstrap with public domain bootstrap images,
make sure that default start address is 173000 because this PDP-11 emulator
always start at that location.  To get public domain bootstraps, check
ftp://ftp.dbit.com.

I have a copy of 32K KDJ11B firmware image but it is not compatible with
current BDV11 and MRV12 boot device implementation.  I still am looking
for more MRV11 series specs like MRV11D, etc. to able execute KDJ11B
firmware image.

Operating Systems
-----------------
This PDP-11 emulator supports many operating systems.  However, some
might not work properly due to lack of DEC operating systems here.
Only two known operating systems successfully booted - RT-11 v5.3 and
XXDP v2.2/v2.5.

Instructions to run the emulator
--------------------------------

This TS10 emulator now have socket interface so that you can telnet into
the TS10 emulator by usint telnet command.

$ telnet <hostname> <port>

With TS10 default, its port is 5000.  You can change it in
a 'dev/dec/dl.h' file.

To run the TS10 emulator system first: (If no TS10> prompt displayed,
just press CR key to print it.)

$ ./ts10 -f kdf11.cfg  (or kdj11.cfg)
  -------------------
TS10>


To enter the VAX system on other xterm or terminal, type:

$ telnet localhost 5000
  ---------------------
Welcome to PDP-11 Emulator


Then run system at TS10> prompt for MicroPDP:

TS10> boot cpu0
      ---------

Then do something on xterm that you are telneting into.  That is all.

commads with usage information.

Thank you!
