---------------------------------------------------------
* Initial TMSCP implementation with using 'rq.c' file.
* Renamed all functions to tq_ and TQ_ prefix names.
* Replaced disk drive tables for new initial (TK50, TK70, and TU81)
  tape drive table.
* Added TMSCP parameters and commands to mscp.h file.
* Changed default CSR address to 774500 from 772150.
* Rewrote some MSCP commands to use tape specific parameters.
* Attempted to compile that and fixed some errors.
* Fixed a bug in response packet routine because it failed to
  recongize packets as TMSCP type (connection id).
* OpenVMS now recongized that TK50, TK70, and TU81 tape controller
  as PTA0: and MUA0: according to 'show device' command.
