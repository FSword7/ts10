v0.7 8/28/02 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in SocketHandler that cause DELQA emulation to stall
  frequently because some unread was left in Linux kernel during SIGIO
  callback.  After it was fixed, DELQA now is smooth and reliable.
  For more information, check ChangeLog file in 'emu' directory.
* Implemented the setup packet parser to extract ethernet addresses,
  set flags for promiscious or all multicasts, etc.
* Added Unit header to QNA device and Changed all devName and keyName
  to Unit.devName and Unit.keyName variables.  Also, renamed all keyName
  to devName so that debug.log will show more specific XQA0: instead of
  DELQA:, etc. 
* Added 'info' command to display Ethernet controller information.

v0.6a 5/17/02 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------
* Created a new create routine and removed old create and
  setup routines.
* Removed a patch from the setup packet routine because it blocked
  OpenVMS from receiving packets from outside and I learned that
  a bug in NetBSD 1.5.2 according to NetBSD/vax port mailing list.
  I now was able telnet or ftp into OpenVMS from outside or via.

v0.6 3/20/02 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------
* Added key names of DELQA and DESQA to Unibus/Qbus list.
* Changed transmission routines to allow send all frames outgoing
  instead of just one frame at once.  After it was fixed,
  DEQNA get much further.  Transmission timers will be implemented
  soon.
* Made a patch on the setup packet routines for some tests.
  It will be removed when all problems have been resolved.

v0.5 3/18/02 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug that TS10 emulator system crashes into segmentation
  fault when NetBSD/vax attempted to initialize DELQA controller
  during boot time.  NetBSD/vax uses positive number as buffer length
  instead of negative number.  Fixed it by changed to 'absolute value'
  of number.

v0.2 3/16/02 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
