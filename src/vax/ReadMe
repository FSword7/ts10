VAX emulator v0.8.2 (Alpha)

Note: this ts10 emulator works so well on x86 and Alpha machines.

OpenVMS v7.3
------------

OpenVMS 7.3 is running fine.

To obtain a copy of OpenVMS, order a Hobbyist CD v3.0 from Montgar
for $30 US dollars. For more information, check at
http://www.montgar.com/hobbyist.  You have to be an Encompass
(DECUS) member to order that.

For Hobbyist CD v1.0 and v2.0, you have ask someone that have a older
copy of Hobbyist CD to borrow.  Earliest version of OpenVMS is working
so well - VAX/VMS v5.4.  Earlier than VMS v5.4 is not tested yet.

About Hobbyist OpenVMS CD v1.0, there are many versions of VMS from v5.5 to
v6.2.

About Hobbyist OpenVMS CD v2.0, there are a copy of OpenVMS v7.2 and
selected products.  Because there is a bug in TCP/IP v5.0, any telnet
session will not work with XTERM id.  For more information about solution,
see the Ethernet section below.

About Hobbyist OpenVMS CD v3.0, there are a copy of OpenVMS v7.3 and
selected products. everything is running fine.

There is known bug in VAX emulator.  When root disk was not unmounted
properly (quit emulator without shutdown procedure), attempts to boot the
OpenVMS operating system, it takes forever.  On DCL prompt, attempt to
mount the root disk, it takes forever.  Only way to restore root disk from
backup.  Save your root disk files each time before attempt to boot
system.

For more discussions, check comp.os.vms newsgroup.

NetBSD/vax 1.5.2
----------------

NetBSD/vax 1.5.2 is running fine.

To obtain a copy of NetBSD/vax 1.5.2, check http://www.netbsd.org
for more information.  You need least 400 MB disk space to perform
full installation.  Use RZ24 disk drive or larger.

DEC Ultrix 4.x
--------------

Ultrix 4.x is running fine.


DEQNA/DELQA Ethernet Controller
-------------------------------

For more information about TAP/TUN tunnel driver interface, check
http://vtun.sourceforge.net.

If tun module is not loaded on Red Hat Linux system, log into system as
root and enter that lines on your shell prompt:

  mkdir /dev/net
  mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
  modprobe tun

To hook up this VAX emulator to LAN network area.

Run TS10 emulator to open TAP/TUN connection first.  Make sure
to create any ethernet controller in configuration file:
DEQNA or DELQA.  For OpenVMS v7.x, use DELQA because DEQNA is not
supported on current OpenVMS versions.

  ./ts10 -f ka655.cfg

Then set up interface configurations. Login into system as root.
Following instructions here.

  ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.1 pointopoint 192.168.0.2 up
  route add 192.168.0.2 gw 192.168.0.1  (Optional)

  Note: TS10 Emulator        192.168.0.2
        TAP/TUN Connection   192.168.0.1

if you want to monitor TUN/TAP connection as traffic, login into
system as root and use tcpdump or ethereal.

  tcpdump -i tap0

There is a bug in TCPIP v5.0 that comes with OpenVMS 7.2 Hobbyist CD
distribution.  Upgrade it to v5.1 or later.  For working-around
solution, set TERM to vt100 or vt102 that OpenVMS 7.2 knows for
telnet initialization.  Other TCP/IP software like TCPWARE or MultiNet,
they worked fine.  Or get the OpenVMS 7.3 Hobbyist CD (v3.0).

  export TERM=vt100
  telnet 192.168.0.2

DELQA is a high-speed broadband device.  On 1.9 Ghz P4 system, FTP speed
was estimated 650KB/sec to 800KB/sec.  Downloading a 30 MB file takes
estimated 45 seconds to complete.

Warning: On telnet sessions, output are very extremely fast.  Try
'TYPE SYS$MANAGER:TCPIP$CONFIG.COM' and you will find out that
scrolling is too damn fast!

Recently someone reported on comp.os.vms newsgroup that DECwindows
successfully worked so well on TS10/VAX emulator.

Jnet VAX v3.x (Historic BITNET network)
---------------------------------------

Jnet VAX 3.x is working so well on the TS10/VAX emulator running
OpenVMS v7.2.  Jnet provides RSCS network with other systems like IBM
mainframe.  For make a link to other system outside, install Jnet and
TCPNJE software into OpenVMS system and following instructions below.

Put a line into JAN_SYS:JANLINKS.JCP or run JANCONFIG.COM

   DEFINE <linkname> /LINK /DAEMON=TCPNJE /LINE=UCX

Create <linkname>.PAR in JAN_SYS:

   TCP.RMTNODE = <host address>
   TCP.RMTPORT = 175
   TCP.LCLPORT = 175
   OPRMSG = YES
   BUFF   = 4096

Then run JCP (Jnet Control Program)

   $ SET DEF JAN_SYS:
   $ RUN JCP
   JCP> START <linkname>
   JCP> EXIT
   $

Funet-NJE RSCS emulator
-----------------------

That is developed for Unix systems.  However, this version is not compatible
with current Linux platforms.  Good news!  I successfully ported that
to Linux platform.  I successfully send messages and files to and from the
VAX emulator via NJE connection.   However, there is a bug in Jnet 3.x 
cause that BCB sequence error after Funet-NJE successfully connected to
Jnet 3.x.  However, it only worked fine when Jnet connected to Funet-NJE
(passive connection).  That requires Jnet TCPNJE driver in order to work
properly.  Devices for BSC/SNA connections are not implemented yet.

Funet-NJE RSCS emulator with source code is available at
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/networking/bitnet.


PowerTerm by Ericom, Inc.
-------------------------

For best terminal emulation for OpenVMS operating system, I strongly
recommend that PowerTerm InterConnect Linux Edition software by Ericom,
Inc.  For more information about PowerTerm products, check
http://www.ericom.com.

I myself tried PowerTerm Linux edition with this emulator and was 
impressed by more accurate and faster terminal emulation than 'xterm'
program.  If you want freeware version, try 'xterm', not Gnome, KDE
terminal, etc. because many terminal emulation software execpt xterm
is not compatible with some OpenVMS commands (LSE, help, etc.)


DHV11/DHQ11/DHU11 Terminal Controller
-------------------------------------

TCP port for DHV11 emulation is 5010.  It accepts up to 8 TTY lines
at this time.  For downloads, etc, set /DMA option on SET TERMINAL command
on DCL prompt (OpenVMS):

   set terminal txa0: /dma

of RH11 controller and its MASSBUS drives specifications at this time 
(for PDP-10 emulator).  Also, I need Q-bus specification for MicroVAX II.

When you develop your desired device handling routines, please include
complete specification documents as much as possible so that other developers
and I can understand how they work clearly.

I have a copy of VAX Aritecture Handbook (1st edition - 1987) and VAX Internal
and Data Sturctures Handbook.  I am looking for a copy of 2nd edition (1991)
for complete vector instructions and other latest models.


VAX Emulator Developement Status
--------------------------------

VAX Emulator currently supports three different series: KA630, KA65x,
and KA780.  All instructions passed HCORE tests for CVAX (KA650) series.

Module Completed
----------------
MicroVAX II Series        - Almost finished.
MicroVAX 3800/3900 Series - Almost finished.
VAX-11/780 Series         - Under development.

Module Not Implemented Yet
--------------------------
MicroVAX 3100 Series

MicroVAX 3100 Series:

I does not have a copy of KA4x ROM images at this time.  Does anyone
have a copy of KA42/KA43 ROM images and a copy of 3100 tech manuals?
If so, please let me know that.  Thank you.

VAX-11/780 Series:

Now I have 11/780 hardware docs (from DFWCUG web site).  They now are
under development at this time.  I have docs about how to load and run
VMB.EXE program from boot drive.

Instructions to run the emulator
--------------------------------

This TS10 emulator now have socket interface so that you can telnet into
the TS10 emulator by usint telnet command.

$ telnet <hostname> <port>

With TS10 default, its port is 5000.  You can change it in a dev_cty.h file.

To run the TS10 emulator system first: (If no TS10> prompt displayed,
just press CR key to print it.)

$ ./ts10 -f ka630.cfg
  -------------------
TS10>


To enter the VAX system on other xterm or terminal, type:

$ telnet localhost 5000
  ---------------------
Welcome to VAX Emulator


Then run system at TS10> prompt for MicroVAX II:

TS10> boot cpu0
      ---------

Then do something on xterm that you are telneting into.  That is all.

For more information about TS10/VAX commands, just press '?' to list
commads with usage information.

Thank you!
