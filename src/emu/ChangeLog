v0.8.9d - 1/5/2003 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------------
* Made some corrections that make Intel C/C++ compiler so happy
  by adding some protoype declarations, etc.
* Added byteswap.h and endian.h in defs.h file for both big-endian
  and little-endian machines for Linux platforms.
* Implemented the own inline assembly bswap routines due to a
  bug in GNU's byteswap.h file that does not work with Intel C/C++
  compilers.  New assembly bswap routines are much faster than
  generic bswap routines by eliminating several instructions.
* Removed unused 'SwapLong' and 'SwapWord' from misc.c for new
  assembly bswap support routines.
* Changed ts10_Select's name to ts10_System for better common sense.

v0.8.9c - 8/19/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Made changes in SocketHandler so that socket errors will not
  printed on panel control window, but will be printed in debug
  log file.
* Added DBG_SOCKERR to debug facility for provides socket error
  messages in debug log file.

v0.8.9b - 8/12/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Implemented the real-clock timer queues that provide multi timer
  entries instead of only timer routine. (timer.c)
* Fixed a bug in SocketHandler that cause DELQA emulation to
  stall during heavy traffic from/to Internet/Intranet.
  (found by Peter Svensson)

v0.8.9a - 7/25/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a serious bug in timer routines (in timer.c) that cause
  system to being slowed down to a crawal because negative
  countdown values was calculated for timer calibration.  After
  it was fixed, if ts10_ClkInterval contains negative value,
  it have being reset to zero before new countdown values
  were calculated.
* Fixed a bug in vtape.c (tps_Read and tps_Skip) routine that cause
  BACKUP or DIR ignores EOT encounters and continue.  I confirmed that
  according to monitor sources (TM2KON.MAC) after I studied it and
  other KS10 emulators.  After it had been fixed, zero block size
  always is tape mark and BACKUP finally stopped after two tape
  mark encounters. EOT encounters only applies to attempting to
  write records.
* Added warning report in tps_Read to warn record is too large to fit
  buffer with requested number of bytes.  I discovered that some old
  TPC files from Tim's archives have a dino-sized or behemoth bug (a fake
  64K bytes record after two last tape marks) at its end.  No one noticed
  that for long time until this emulator revealed that.  Good news.
  New TAP files from Tim's archives do not have this bug.

v0.8.9 - 6/13/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------------
* Implemented new virtual disk and tape routines to replace
  old obsolete disk and tape routines.  New support routines
  now provides multi-format.  Obsolete routines will be removed
  later.

v0.8.8a - 5/20/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Reversed the sequence of binding socket and setting flags included
  SO_REUSEADDR option in sock_Open.c and this annoying behaviour
  finally disappeared!  We now do not have wait for a while before
  we can restart the TS10 emulator.  (found by Dennis Henriksen)

v0.8.8 - 5/13/2002 by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
----------------------------------------------------------
* Added new configure command for configuring individual
  drives, terminals, etc. on the same mapping device.
* Removed obsolete create and setup routines and moved
  new create and configure routines to top of function
  calls.  Also, updated all DEVINFO settings through TS10
  emulator system.

v0.8.7 - 3/26/2002 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
------------------------------------------------------------
* Added new create2 command for multi-aliases naming support
  and simpfly Create calls.  Old create command now is obslete.
* Added Create2 function call in Device structure.
* Fixed bugs in commands.c that crashes into segmentation
  fault when device information does not have a listing of
  commands (null pointer).

v0.8.6c - 3/20/2002 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed all SOCK_* to SCK_* names in socket.h to avoid
  conflict with other definitions in system include files.
  That patches that I received from Dennis had been applied.

v0.8.6b - 3/18/2002 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in debug.c that crashes into segmentation fault.
  Thank Dennis for bug report.

v0.8.6a - 1/18/2002 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed some debug-related bugs when attempted to compile without
  debug facility for optimization.
* Implmented file I/O for socket routines to support both file and
  terminal I/O with any commands.
* Implemented initial breakpoint systems for debug facility but
  not finished yet.
* Made changes in command handler so that name of commands can
  be shortened now.

v0.8.6 - 12/14/2001 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Implemented more device functions - debug and boot.

v0.8.5 - 10/30/2001 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in STDIN socket that cause TS10 exit on Solaris.
* Implemented 'show device' to list devices that system has.
* Changed system command tables by adding usage information.
* Renamed some functions by removing ts10_'s, util_'s, etc.
* Implemented the System of Systems routines.
* Replaced the old dynamic device mapping for new ones.

v0.8.0 - 9/6/2001 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in the simulation timer system that cause 10,000
  count down instead of its desired count down in ts10_SetTimer
  routine.
* Replaced the old timer system for the new simulation and real
  timer routines to provide better services for delayed I/O accesses,
  ticks, etc.  For real timer system, its only limitation is least 10
  milliseconds due to Linux operating system.
* Implemented initial help system with a '?' key.
* Implemented the repetitive command handling for 'dump' and
  'disasm' command without any options to advance by just press
  'CR' key.
* Extended socket/SIGIO handling to keyboard and screen for real
  timeshare.  Operators now are able to mount pack/tape files
  on console prompt without affecting running emulated
  processor(s).

v0.7.2 - 3/20/2001 - by Timothy Stark <sword7@speakeasy.org>
------------------------------------------------------------
* A bug in console_Prompt had been fixed.  When you just press
  return, TS10 emulator crashed with segmentation violation.
* Patches had been applied to tape.c for big-endian machines.
* Socket routines initially had been implemented for CTY,
  DZ11, and others.
